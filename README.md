# Medication-Reminder

The Med Reminder App Code is a JavaScript-based solution designed to create a medication reminder application. This code utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to generate dynamic medication reminder forms. Users can add multiple medication entries, each with fields for medication name, time selection, frequency, date, and reminder sound. The application allows users to set reminders for their medications and maintains a list of these reminders. Additionally, each medication entry contains a "Remove" button for easy deletion of individual reminders. This application provides a user-friendly interface for managing medication schedules and reminders.
